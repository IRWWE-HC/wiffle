		<h1 class="USdirHeading"> Richard Lin </h1> <br>
		<p class="centerText"> 
		The primary front-end developer of this project. He wrote all of the CSS (minus the one line Edward wrote) and Javascript, and most of the HTML. His job was to make things pretty, and make elements interact on the page. 
		</p>
		<p id="bordered" class="centerText">
		He’s a big fan of fried chicken, very fast food, and proving people wrong with words. He channels these adorations toward Speech and Debate, and McDonalds. Mostly McDonalds. 
		</p>
		
		<h1 class="USdirHeading"> Edward Tsang </h1> <br>
		<p class="centerText">	
		The primary back-end developer of this project. He wrote most of the python, and was in charge of the login systems and linking together the files.
		</p>
		<p id="bordered" class="centerText">
		In his spare time, he likes long walks on beaches, holding hands while drifting into the sunset, and building robots. One of those things is actually true. Hint: He’s on the robotics team.
		</p>

		<p class="centerText"> Also HUGE shout out to James Wang, who held Richard's hand during the initial phases of Javascript, and debugged Edward's early Python code. He pushed us out of our nests, and we owe him for that. </p>
