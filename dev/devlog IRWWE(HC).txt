Explanations for Additional Areas of Code:

CSS:
	*Template Section
		*Here, we have a bunch of different html.t<x> stylings, to be applied to different templates that the user selects. Slight gradients and the such are used. We need different webkits so it works in all browsers.
	*Placeholder Text
		*Here, we style the placeholder text so it isn't so drab.
	*Editor Styles
		*Styles the editor of the website. It places the elements of the editor in the correct places, and makes them look presentable.
	*Navbar Styles	
		*Styles the nav bar, so it looks clean.
	*Output Styles	
		*Styles the viewing page of the website. Very similar to editor styles
	*Homepage Styles
		*Styles the homepage and transitions within the homepage.

Javascript:
	*Sidebar Slot creator
		*On press of a + button, the javascript creates an additional sidebar slot
	*Semi-Real Time Update
		*When one clicks out of the input box, the javascript changes it to html. When you click back on the text, it becomes an input box again. This allows for the real time ability to see what your website is like.
	*Transitions
		*On clicks, hovers or page loads (depending on the circumstance), elements will fade in, fade out, slide up and slide down. Wheeee!
		
Python:
	*User storage
		*Grabs hidden forms within the HTML to remember the user names, and thus allow the website to store the files for permanent viewing
